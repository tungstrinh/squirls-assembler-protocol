## Overview

ACORN (A Clinically Oriented Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network) is a large-scale, prospective, case-based AMR surveillance initiative conducted across nine low- and middle-income countries in Africa and Asia. A whole genome sequencing (WGS) component was incorporated, to sequence 200 isolates per country.

On-site whole genome sequencing faced multiple challenges, including constraints in supply chain logistics, reagent and consumable distribution and availability, cost fluctuations, and limitations in local bioinformatics infrastructure. Here, we want to address the last problem with a simple desktop application for long- and short-read genomic data; allowing standardised, easily accessible assembly to be distributed across multiple sentinel sites without the need for local bioinformatics.

This repository contains the hybrid assembly pipeline which is designed for assembling genomic data based on a provided samplesheet. The pipeline supports different assemblers depending on the type of sequencing reads provided. 

The containerlised app and GUI can be downloaded [here](https://oucruaap-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/tungts_oucru_org/EkI45Tv6kzJAv7lSh6udrqgBCcyk_RvQp5DZQGdK18sMpg?e=5ooOEG) and full [installation instruction](https://cgps-discovery.github.io/acorn-assembler-protocol/).

This work is funded by [ACORN network](https://acornamr.net/#/), a collaboration between [Oxford University Clinical Research Unit - Hanoi (OUCRU-HN)](https://www.oucru.org/location/oucru-ha-noi/) and [Centre for Genomic Pathogen Surveillance (CGPS)](https://www.pathogensurveillance.net/).
